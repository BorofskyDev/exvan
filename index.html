          <p class="about-card-content">I am a geriatric millennial. I was raised Southern Baptist and even attended two
            different SBC seminaries. I was also
            raised in an incredibly conservative home and grew up on Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly, and
            others. I
            abandoned most of my conservative views sometime in my mid-20s, but only began questioning my faith over a
            decade later.
            I am now an adventurer trying to make sense out of the senselessness of life.</p>

        <p class="about-text">When deconstructing you will find yourself vacillating between two seemingly opposite
          feelings, but paradoxically they
          are the same. First, you will feel the euphoria of freedom, of a life that is limited by hope of Heaven or
          fear of Hell,
          a life where you can properly choose who you want to be. Second, you will feel utterly, completely lost and
          alone, but
          this feeling only exists because of the first.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">
          For some, to leave their faith is a rather simple act. Their careers aren’t dependent on their faith, their
          familial
          relations exist outside of a faith structure, their community exists outside of their faith, in short, their
          faith is an
          add-on to their life. To others, such as myself, their faith is their life. To abandon their faith is to
          abandon all
          that they are, all that they have, everything they’ve been built up to be. Tt is not just a deconstruction of
          their
          beliefs, it’s a deconstruction of their entire identity as a human being.

        <p class="about-text">
          I was aiming to be the next big thing in Christianity. I truly believed in Christianity, even if at times I
          questioned
          things and pushed the limits. I am a former seminary student, someone who wanted to be an evangelist, then a
          pastor, and
          then a professor of Christian philosophy. I wanted to save this world for Christ. I rubbed shoulders with
          people who now
          advise politicians, I was friends with men who went on to be pastors who have held rallies for Donald Trump
          and had him
          in their pulpits. And now, midway through my life, I am left sifting through the pieces of a me that I fully
          destroyed,
          trying to discover which parts are a part of who I am, and which parts were thrust on me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">Where do I go from here?</p>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">
          Well, I guess that is the entire point of this blog. When I was a Christian I wrote. For over a decade I ran a
          blog that
          at times would bring in a few thousand visitors a day, but it’s unlikely you or anyone you know heard of it
          (or have
          heard of me). I won’t link to it because it’s inactive and some spam service has taken over the domain site.
          Over a
          decade of writings are gone and I couldn’t be happier. It’s rather poetic, in a way. Writing was an escape for
          me, a way
          to wrestle with my thoughts. Leaving the faith took that from me because I didn’t want others to find out that
          I was
          abandoning my faith. Most still don’t know, at least not officially, though I suspect that they suspect my
          agnosticism.
          Such is the power of fundamentalist faith.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="about-subtitle">What this isn't</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">
          This isn’t a blog about how evil Christianity is or how people are stupid for believing it. Personally, I have
          a soft
          spot for religious people who found their religion in love and who live it, and that includes Christians. I
          might point
          out some inconsistencies in the arguments Christians use to defend their faith, but it won’t be a focal point
          because
          I’m just not interested in that aspect of living.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">
          This isn’t a place where I will air my grievances against Christians all the time, though it will happen. This
          isn’t
          some hardcore atheist blog where I’ll explore all the dirty details of Christianity “behind the scenes.”
          That’s been
          done so much that at this point it’s a trope. It’d be like making another origin story for a superhero – yeah,
          we get
          it, get on with the story already.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="about-subtitle">What this is</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">
          I want this to be a spot where I share my thoughts on life, Christianity, the ongoings of the world, and maybe
          a little
          hope sprinkled in for good measure. This is me processing my beliefs and experiences. I do have what is slowly
          being
          accepted as “religious trauma,” I did endure quite a bit and I might explore some of that. To be honest,
          however, there
          are a lot of painful memories that I’d rather remain memories rather than part of a memorandum.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">
          When I wrote before I obsessed over how many people would view my site, one posting everyday so I could get
          more clicks.
          I wanted a big name, I wanted attention, I wanted to be someone. Now, I’ve built my own website and didn’t put
          any site
          tracking on it because I just don’t care. I haven’t plastered my name all over, though I have left an image to
          show that
          I am, in fact, a real person. It’s a semi-anonymous site (though it wouldn’t take Sherlock Holmes to discover
          who I am –
          I have my picture on here…).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="about-text">
          This is, in short, my therapy. It’s me getting back into writing, on sharing my thoughts. You’re welcome to
          read and
          agree, disagree, laugh, cry, or whatever the fuck you wish. Perhaps you’re someone who is facing that dilemma
          of knowing
          you can’t live your life as a Christian (or Muslim, or Jew, or any other fundamentalist branch of any other
          religion).
          Perhaps you’re beginning to find both fear and delight in that feeling of freedom. Through these writings I
          hope you
          will see that while you might be in exile, you are not alone. You might find yourself in the wilderness of
          doubt, of
          lost identity, know that ultimately you not an aimless wanderer but a brave explorer who has finally embarked
          upon the
          greatest adventure in which anyone can partake; the discovery of you.
